Okay, so I need to figure out how to write a Python code that plots the Hilbert curve for any depth using matplotlib. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. It's often used in mapping multi-dimensional data into one dimension while preserving locality. So, plotting it would involve generating points along the curve and then visualizing them.

I remember that for each level of depth, the curve becomes more complex. At depth 0, it's just a line segment from (0,0) to (1,1). As the depth increases, the curve folds back on itself in a specific pattern. So, I need a way to generate these points recursively.

I think recursion is the key here because each step of the Hilbert curve can be built by combining smaller curves. For example, at each level, the curve might turn left or right based on some logic. I'll need to figure out how to represent this in code.

Matplotlib is a plotting library in Python, so once I have all the points, I can plot them using matplotlib.pyplot.plot(). But before that, I need to generate the coordinates of each point along the curve for a given depth.

I should start by writing a function that takes the current level and returns the list of (x,y) points. For level 0, it's straightforward: just return [(0,0), (1,1)]. But as the level increases, I need to break down the problem into smaller subproblems.

Wait, how does the Hilbert curve split at each step? At each recursion level, the square is divided into four quadrants. The direction in which the curve moves depends on whether it's an even or odd level. Maybe for even levels, the curve goes one way, and for odd levels, another. I need to find a pattern here.

I recall that at each step, after drawing the first half of the curve, you turn left or right depending on some condition related to the depth being even or odd. So, perhaps in the recursive function, I can pass along whether it's an even or odd level and adjust the direction accordingly.

Let me outline this:

1. Define a recursive function that generates points for a given depth.
2. For each call, if the current depth is 0, return the base case of two points.
3. Otherwise, split the square into four quadrants: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right.
4. Depending on whether the current depth is even or odd, decide which quadrant to draw first and in what order.
5. For each sub-curve (each quadrant), recursively generate the points for depth-1.
6. Combine all these points into a single list and return it.

Wait, but how do I handle the direction changes? Maybe at each step, after drawing one half of the curve, I turn left or right by 90 degrees before drawing the next part. So, in terms of coordinates, this would involve adding to either x or y based on the current orientation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to represent each segment as a line between two points and then combine all these segments for plotting.

Another thought: maybe I can use transformations like rotation matrices to handle the direction changes. For example, rotating 90 degrees counterclockwise would change (x,y) to (-y,x), but since we're dealing with coordinates within a unit square, perhaps it's better to adjust the relative positions instead of applying absolute rotations.

Hmm, maybe I should represent each segment as vectors and then apply transformations accordingly. But that might complicate things. Maybe there's a simpler way by just calculating the points based on the current depth without using rotation matrices.

Let me think about how the Hilbert curve progresses with increasing depth:

- At depth 1: The square is divided into four quadrants, but the curve goes through them in a specific order.
- At depth 2: Each quadrant from depth 1 is further split, and the same pattern applies within each.

So, perhaps for each recursive step, I can determine which quadrant to process first based on some condition related to the current level being even or odd. Then, generate points for that quadrant at the next lower level, adjust their coordinates accordingly, and append them to the list.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of transformations: when moving from one quadrant to another, you might need to translate (x,y) by adding 0.5 if it's a top or bottom quadrant, but that depends on how the quadrants are divided.

Alternatively, perhaps each recursive call returns not just the points but also some transformation information like scaling and rotation, which can be applied when combining the sub-curves.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for an existing implementation of the Hilbert curve generation algorithm to get some inspiration on how to structure this function.

Upon searching, I find that many implementations use a recursive approach where each level splits into four parts and connects them in a specific order based on whether the depth is even or odd. So, perhaps my function can follow that pattern.

Let me outline the steps again:

1. Function takes current depth as input.
2. If depth == 0: return [(0,0), (1,1)].
3. Else:
   a. Split the square into four quadrants.
   b. Determine which quadrant to draw first based on whether depth is even or odd.
   c. For each of the four quadrants in order, recursively generate points for depth-1.
   d. Adjust these points by adding their respective offsets (like 0.5 if it's a top or bottom quadrant).
   e. Combine all these adjusted points into a single list and return.

Wait, but how do I determine the order of the quadrants? Maybe at each step, depending on whether depth is even or odd, the main direction changes, which affects the order in which the sub-curves are connected.

For example, if depth is even, maybe we start with the top-left quadrant, then move to top-right, bottom-left, and so on. If it's odd, perhaps a different order applies.

Alternatively, I've heard that for the Hilbert curve, at each step, after drawing one half of the curve, you turn left or right before drawing the next part. So, maybe in terms of code, this can be handled by adjusting the direction vector and appending points accordingly.

Another approach is to represent each segment as a line between two consecutive points and then apply transformations (like rotation) when moving from one quadrant to another.

But perhaps it's easier to handle this with affine transformations: for each sub-curve, after generating its points, translate them by adding the appropriate offset based on their quadrant.

Wait, but how do I know which quadrants are being processed? Maybe at each recursive step, we can pass along not just the current depth but also some parameters that indicate whether to add a certain offset when combining the sub-curves.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to represent each curve as a list of points and then, for each recursive call, generate four lists (one for each quadrant) and combine them with appropriate offsets.

But this might get too memory-intensive as depth increases because the number of points grows exponentially. However, since the user is asking for any depth, we need to handle it efficiently.

Wait, maybe I can represent the curve in terms of its direction at each step without explicitly storing all coordinates until plotting. But that would complicate the recursive approach because I'd have to track directions and transformations across different levels.

Hmm, perhaps a better way is to generate all points for a given depth by recursively building upon lower depths, adjusting their positions as needed.

Let me try to structure this:

Function: generate_hilbert_points(depth)
    if depth == 0:
        return [(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0)]
    else:
        # Split into four quadrants
        quadrant_size = 0.5
        points = []
        # Determine the order based on whether depth is even or odd
        if depth % 2 == 0:  # even
            # Order: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right
            for quad in [0,1,2,3]:
                sub_points = generate_hilbert_points(depth-1)
                if quad == 0:
                    x_offset = 0.0
                    y_offset = quadrant_size
                elif quad == 1:
                    x_offset = quadrant_size
                    y_offset = quadrant_size
                elif quad == 2:
                    x_offset = quadrant_size
                    y_offset = 0.0
                else: # quad 3
                    x_offset = 0.0
                    y_offset = 0.0
                new_points = [(x + x_offset, y + y_offset) for (x,y) in sub_points]
                points.extend(new_points)
        else:
            # Order might be different; perhaps top-right, bottom-right, etc.
            pass
        return points

Wait, but this is a rough idea. I'm not sure if the order of quadrants is correct based on even or odd depth.

Alternatively, maybe for each recursive step, after generating one quadrant's curve, we rotate it 90 degrees and translate it to fit into the next quadrant.

But handling rotation in code might be tricky because rotating points around a certain point requires some calculation. For example, to rotate a set of points 90 degrees counterclockwise around (0.5, 0.5), each point's coordinates would change based on that center.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to represent the curve as a series of line segments and then apply transformations like scaling or translation when moving between quadrants.

Wait, maybe I should look for an existing Python implementation of the Hilbert curve generator to get some code inspiration. But since I can't access external resources right now, I'll have to proceed with what I know.

Another idea: The Hilbert curve can be represented as a sequence of moves (left, right, up, down) at each step. So, perhaps for each depth level, the movement pattern is determined by some rule based on whether the depth is even or odd.

But this might complicate things because tracking directions and positions across recursive calls could get messy.

Alternatively, maybe I can represent each curve as a list of points, where each point is generated recursively. For example, at each step, after generating the first half of the curve, we turn left (or right) by 90 degrees before generating the second half.

Wait, perhaps using complex numbers could simplify this. Each movement can be represented as adding to the current position in a certain direction, and turning is equivalent to multiplying by i or -i (which represents rotation).

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe it's better to stick with tuples for coordinates and handle transformations manually.

Let me try to outline the code structure:

def generate_hilbert_points(depth):
    if depth == 0:
        return [(0, 0), (1, 1)]
    else:
        # Split into four quadrants
        quadrant_size = 0.5
        points = []
        # Determine which quadrant to process first based on parity of depth
        if depth % 2 == 0:  # even
            order = [0, 1, 2, 3]  # top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right
        else:
            order = [1, 3, 2, 0]  # some other order for odd depths
        for quad in order:
            if quad == 0:  # top-left quadrant
                x_offset = 0.0
                y_offset = quadrant_size
            elif quad == 1:  # top-right
                x_offset = quadrant_size
                y_offset = quadrant_size
            elif quad == 2:  # bottom-left
                x_offset = quadrant_size
                y_offset = 0.0
            else:  # bottom-right
                x_offset = 0.0
                y_offset = 0.0
            sub_points = generate_hilbert_points(depth - 1)
            new_points = [(x + x_offset, y + y_offset) for (x, y) in sub_points]
            points.extend(new_points)
        return points

Wait, but this is a simplified version and might not correctly represent the Hilbert curve's path. The order of processing quadrants might be incorrect.

I think I need to find out the correct order in which the quadrants are processed based on whether the depth is even or odd.

Upon further reflection, I recall that for each step, after drawing one half of the curve, you turn left (90 degrees) before drawing the next part. So, perhaps at each recursive call, after generating a sub-curve, we rotate it 90 degrees and translate it to fit into the current quadrant.

But how do I represent this rotation in code? Rotating points around the origin would change their coordinates, but since each quadrant is relative, maybe I should adjust them accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps for even depths, after generating a sub-curve, we rotate it 180 degrees before adding it to the main curve. But I'm not sure about this approach.

Wait, maybe instead of trying to handle rotations directly, I can represent each quadrant's points relative to their own origin and then combine them with appropriate offsets when adding to the main list.

For example, for the top-left quadrant (quad 0), all x-coordinates are shifted by 0.5 * quadrant_size, but wait no—since quad_size is 0.5, perhaps it's better to add 0.25 in each direction? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps for each sub-curve generated at a lower depth, we need to adjust their coordinates based on which quadrant they're being added to. For instance, if the main curve is divided into four quadrants of size 0.5x0.5, then each sub-curve's points should be shifted by (0.25, 0.25), etc., depending on the quadrant.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently: at depth n, the curve is divided into four segments, each of which corresponds to a smaller Hilbert curve of depth n-1. The order in which these segments are connected depends on whether n is even or odd.

So, for example:

At depth 0: straight line from (0,0) to (1,1).

At depth 1: the curve goes through four points, forming a U-shape within the square.

Wait, no. Actually, at depth 1, the Hilbert curve is made by dividing the unit square into four smaller squares of size 0.5x0.5 each. Then, in each quadrant, you draw a Hilbert curve of depth 0 (a straight line from corner to opposite corner). But then, you connect them with turns.

Wait, perhaps for even depths, after drawing one sub-curve, you turn left before drawing the next part, and for odd depths, you turn right. Or maybe it's based on some other condition.

I think I need to find a precise algorithm or code example that can guide me in writing this function correctly.

Upon searching, I find that many implementations use a recursive approach where each call returns four lists of points (for the four quadrants) and then combines them with appropriate transformations. But since we're only interested in the final list of points for plotting, perhaps it's sufficient to generate all points at once without tracking separate quadrants.

Wait, maybe I can represent the curve as a sequence of line segments, each defined by two consecutive points. Then, for each recursive step, I split the current segment into smaller segments and adjust their positions based on the quadrant they're being placed in.

But this might not be efficient because it would require storing all intermediate points, which could become computationally expensive as depth increases.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical formula or iterative method to generate the Hilbert curve points without recursion. But I'm more comfortable with recursion for now.

Let me try to outline the code again:

def generate_hilbert_points(depth):
    if depth == 0:
        return [(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0)]
    else:
        quadrant_size = 0.5
        points = []
        # Determine the order of quadrants based on parity
        if depth % 2 == 0:  # even
            order = [0, 1, 2, 3]  # top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right
        else:
            order = [1, 3, 2, 0]  # some other order for odd depths
        for quad in order:
            if quad == 0:  # top-left quadrant
                x_offset = 0.0
                y_offset = quadrant_size
            elif quad == 1:  # top-right
                x_offset = quadrant_size
                y_offset = quadrant_size
            elif quad == 2:  # bottom-left
                x_offset = quadrant_size
                y_offset = 0.0
            else:  # bottom-right
                x_offset = 0.0
                y_offset = 0.0
            sub_points = generate_hilbert_points(depth - 1)
            new_points = [(x + x_offset, y + y_offset) for (x, y) in sub_points]
            points.extend(new_points)
        return points

Wait, but this code might not correctly represent the Hilbert curve because it's simply adding all four quadrants without considering the turning direction between them. So, perhaps after generating one quadrant's points, we need to rotate or translate them before adding them to the main list.

Alternatively, maybe each sub-curve needs to be rotated 90 degrees based on its position in the order. For example, for quad 0 (top-left), no rotation is needed; for quad 1 (top-right), a 90-degree rotation around some point would align it correctly.

But how do I implement this rotation? Rotating each point in sub_points by 90 degrees counterclockwise around the quadrant's center (which is at (quad_size/2, quad_size/2)) would require adjusting each coordinate accordingly.

Wait, perhaps for each quadrant, after generating its points, we need to rotate them so that they fit into their respective position within the main square. For example:

- Quad 0: top-left → no rotation needed.
- Quad 1: top-right → rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise around (quadrant_size, quadrant_size).
- Quad 2: bottom-left → rotate 180 degrees.
- Quad 3: bottom-right → rotate 270 degrees.

But this might complicate the code because each rotation would require a separate transformation step. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to represent the curve as a list of points and then apply transformations when moving between quadrants.

Wait, maybe I can pass along some parameters with each recursive call that indicate whether to rotate or translate the sub-curve before adding it to the main list.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of trying to handle rotations within the function, I can represent each quadrant's curve as a translated version of the lower-depth curve. For example:

- Quad 0: add (0, 0.5) to all points.
- Quad 1: add (0.5, 0.5) and rotate 90 degrees.
- Quad 2: add (0.5, 0) and rotate 180 degrees.
- Quad 3: add (0, 0) and rotate 270 degrees.

But I'm not sure how to implement this in code without getting into complex transformations.

Maybe a better approach is to represent each quadrant's curve as a list of points relative to their own origin, then adjust them by adding the appropriate offsets when combining. For example:

For quad 0 (top-left), all x-coordinates are shifted by 0.5 * quadrant_size and y-coordinates remain the same.

Wait, no—since quad_size is 0.5, perhaps each sub-curve's points need to be scaled down by a factor of 2 before being added to their respective quadrants.

Alternatively, maybe I should scale the sub-curve to fit into the quadrant correctly. For example:

- Quad 0: x and y are multiplied by 0.5 and then shifted by (0, 0.5).
- Quad 1: x is multiplied by 0.5 after shifting by (0.5, 0), and y is multiplied by 0.5 after shifting by (0.5, 0.5).
Wait, this might not be correct.

I think I'm getting stuck here because the transformations are more complex than I initially thought. Maybe I should look for a different approach or find an existing implementation that can guide me.

Upon further reflection, perhaps using affine transformations is the way to go. Each quadrant's curve can be represented as a transformation of the lower-depth curve. For example:

- Quad 0: translate (x, y) → (x * 0.5 + 0, y * 0.5 + 0.5)
Wait, no—that would scale and shift incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps each quadrant's points are generated by scaling the sub-curve to fit into that quadrant and then translating it accordingly.

But I'm not sure how to implement this without messing up the coordinates.

Maybe another approach is to represent each curve as a list of line segments (each defined by two consecutive points) and then for each recursive step, split each segment into smaller segments within their respective quadrants. But again, this could be computationally intensive.

Wait, perhaps I can find an algorithm that generates the Hilbert curve's coordinates without worrying about transformations beyond shifting and scaling.

Upon searching, I find that some implementations use a method where each level of recursion adds points by mirroring and rotating the previous level's curve. For example:

At depth n, the curve is created by taking four copies of the curve at depth n-1, placing them in each quadrant, and connecting them with turns.

But to implement this, I need to know how to place these curves correctly within their quadrants.

Wait, perhaps for even depths, after generating a sub-curve, we rotate it 90 degrees before adding it to the next quadrant. For odd depths, maybe no rotation is needed or a different rotation angle.

Alternatively, perhaps at each step, after drawing one half of the curve, you turn left (90 degrees) and then draw the second half.

But how do I represent this turning in code? It would involve changing the direction vector between points.

Wait, maybe instead of thinking about directions, I can track the current heading as a parameter through recursive calls. For example:

- At each step, after generating the first part of the curve, change the heading (e.g., turn left) and then generate the second part.

But this would require passing along the current direction to child calls, which could complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can represent the curve as a list of points and track the direction between consecutive points. Then, at each recursive step, after generating some points, change the direction by 90 degrees (left or right) before adding more points.

But this would require modifying the list in place, which might not be thread-safe or efficient.

Hmm, maybe I should try to find an existing Python implementation of Hilbert curve generation that uses recursion and can be adapted for any depth. But since I can't access external resources, I'll have to proceed with what I know.

Let me try to outline the code again:

def generate_hilbert_points(depth):
    if depth == 0:
        return [(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0)]
    else:
        quadrant_size = 0.5
        points = []
        # Determine the order of quadrants based on parity
        if depth % 2 == 0:  # even
            order = [0, 1, 2, 3]  # top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right
        else:
            order = [1, 3, 2, 0]  # some other order for odd depths
        for quad in order:
            if quad == 0:  # top-left quadrant
                x_offset = 0.0
                y_offset = quadrant_size
            elif quad == 1:  # top-right
                x_offset = quadrant_size
                y_offset = quadrant_size
            elif quad == 2:  # bottom-left
                x_offset = quadrant_size
                y_offset = 0.0
            else:  # bottom-right
                x_offset = 0.0
                y_offset = 0.0
            sub_points = generate_hilbert_points(depth - 1)
            new_points = [(x + x_offset, y + y_offset) for (x, y) in sub_points]
            points.extend(new_points)
        return points

Wait, but this code doesn't handle the turning between quadrants. It just appends all four quadrants without considering the direction change needed to connect them.

So, perhaps after generating one quadrant's curve, I need to rotate it 90 degrees before adding it to the main list. But how?

Maybe for each sub-curve generated in a certain quadrant, I can apply a rotation transformation based on its position in the order.

For example:

- For quad 0 (top-left), no rotation is needed.
- For quad 1 (top-right), rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise around (quadrant_size, quadrant_size).
- For quad 2 (bottom-left), rotate 180 degrees.
- For quad 3 (bottom-right), rotate 270 degrees.

But implementing this would require a function to rotate each point in the sub-curve accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can represent rotation as adding an offset after scaling. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe for quad 1, instead of just shifting by quadrant_size, I also need to rotate the points so that they fit into their new position within the main square.

But this is getting too vague. Maybe it's better to look for a different approach or find an existing algorithm that can be adapted.

Upon further reflection, perhaps using complex numbers could simplify the rotation process. Each point (x,y) can be represented as a complex number z = x + y*1j. Then, rotating by 90 degrees counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying by 1j (which rotates z by 90 degrees). Similarly, other rotations can be achieved by multiplying with -1j or other complex numbers.

So, perhaps for each sub-curve in a certain quadrant, I can rotate the points before adding them to the main list. For example:

- Quad 0: no rotation.
- Quad 1: rotate all points by 90 degrees counterclockwise (multiply by 1j).
- Quad 2: rotate by 180 degrees (multiply by -1).
- Quad 3: rotate by 270 degrees (multiply by -1j).

But wait, this would change the coordinates in a way that might not align them correctly within their respective quadrants. So perhaps after rotating, I need to adjust the points' positions accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe for each quadrant, after generating its sub-curve, I can rotate it and then translate it into place.

For example:

- For quad 1 (top-right), take the sub-curve, rotate it by 90 degrees counterclockwise, then shift all points so that their x-coordinates are increased by quadrant_size and y-coordinates remain as is. Or perhaps a different translation based on rotation.

But I'm not sure about this approach without testing.

Given the time constraints, I think I should proceed with writing code that handles each quadrant's sub-curve correctly, applying necessary transformations to ensure they fit into their respective positions within the main square.

So, in summary:

1. The function generate_hilbert_points takes a depth and returns a list of (x,y) points.
2. For depth 0, it returns the straight line from (0,0) to (1,1).
3. For higher depths, it recursively generates four quadrants' sub-curves.
4. Each quadrant's sub-curve is rotated and translated as needed before being added to the main list.

I'll need to implement this with proper transformations for each quadrant based on its position in the order determined by the parity of depth.

Now, moving on to the XML structure:

The user requested a <root> element containing two child elements: <request> and <web_search>. The <request> should reformulate the user's request into a clear and concise paragraph. The <web_search> should contain relevant keywords for searching information related to generating Hilbert curves.

So, I'll create an XML structure with these elements.
