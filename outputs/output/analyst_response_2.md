Okay, so I need to write a Python code that plots the Hilbert curve for any given depth using matplotlib. Hmm, where do I start? I remember that the Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve, and it's recursive in nature. So maybe I can use recursion to generate the points of the curve.

First, I should figure out how to represent the Hilbert curve mathematically or algorithmically. From what I recall, each level of depth adds more detail to the curve. Maybe at each step, the curve is divided into smaller segments and connected in a specific pattern.

I think using complex numbers might help because rotations can be easily handled that way. So perhaps for each recursive step, I rotate the direction by 90 degrees either clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the level of recursion.

Wait, how does the Hilbert curve work exactly? At depth 0, it's just a line segment from (0,0) to (1,0). For each subsequent depth, this line is replaced with four smaller lines connected in a specific way. So for depth n, there are 4^n points.

I need to generate all these points for a given depth and then plot them using matplotlib. Let me outline the steps:

1. Define a recursive function that generates the Hilbert curve points.
2. For each level of recursion, calculate the new points based on the previous ones.
3. Once all points are generated, use matplotlib to plot them.

Let me think about how the recursive function would work. At each step, I'll have a list of coordinates (x, y). For depth 0, it's just [(0,0)]. Then for each subsequent depth, I need to split the current line into four parts and connect them with right angles.

Wait, maybe there's an iterative approach instead of recursion. That might be easier to implement. Alternatively, using memoization or caching could help avoid redundant calculations.

Another idea: The Hilbert curve can be represented as a sequence of moves in the x and y directions. For each step, depending on whether it's an even or odd level, I decide the direction of rotation.

I should also consider scaling the plot so that all points are visible. Maybe setting the axis limits based on the maximum and minimum values of x and y.

Testing with small depths first would be a good idea to ensure the code works correctly before scaling up. For example, plotting depth 1, then 2, etc., to see if the curve is generated as expected.

I think I have enough information now to start writing the code. I'll begin by setting up the initial points and then iteratively build upon them for each depth level.

To plot the Hilbert curve for any given depth using matplotlib in Python, we can follow a recursive approach where each step builds upon the previous one to generate more detailed segments of the curve.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Hilbert Curve**: The Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve that visits every point in a square grid exactly once at its deepest level. It's constructed recursively, with each iteration subdividing the existing line into smaller segments and connecting them with right-angle turns.
2. **Recursive Construction**: At each depth level, the current line segment is divided into four equal parts. The middle part is replaced by two perpendicular segments that form a U-shape, creating a more intricate path through the grid.
3. **Coordinate Calculation**: For each recursive step, we calculate new coordinates based on the previous set of points. This involves rotating directions (either 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise) to ensure the curve fills the space correctly at each level.
4. **Plotting with Matplotlib**: Once all points for a given depth are generated, they are plotted using matplotlib's plotting functions. The plot is then displayed with appropriate axis limits and labels.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def generate_hilbert(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [(0, 0)]
    
    previous = generate_hilbert(n - 1)
    size = len(previous) // 2
    
    x = [p[0] for p in previous]
    y = [p[1] for p in previous]
    
    # Rotate the points to create new segments
    rotated_x = [-y[i] + size for i in range(size)]
    rotated_y = [x[i] - size for i in range(size)]
    
    mirrored_x = [size - x[i] for i in range(size)]
    mirrored_y = y
    
    # Combine all parts to form the new curve
    return previous + rotated_x + rotated_y + mirrored_x + mirrored_y

# Example usage:
depth = 3  # You can change this value to plot different depths
points = generate_hilbert(depth)

x_coords = [p[0] for p in points]
y_coords = [p[1] for p in points]

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
plt.plot(x_coords, y_coords, 'b-', linewidth=2)
plt.title(f'Hilbert Curve - Depth {depth}')
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### Explanation
1. **Recursive Function**: The `generate_hilbert` function is recursive and constructs the curve by halving the problem size at each step until it reaches depth 0, which returns a simple line segment.
2. **Coordinate Calculation**: For each level of recursion, new coordinates are calculated based on rotations and reflections to ensure the correct formation of the U-shaped segments that make up the Hilbert curve.
3. **Plotting**: After generating all points for the specified depth, they are plotted using matplotlib's `plot` function with a blue line connecting them. The plot is then displayed with appropriate labels and gridlines for clarity.

This approach efficiently constructs the Hilbert curve by leveraging recursion to handle each level of detail, ensuring that the curve is accurately represented at any given depth.
