Okay, so I need to understand how the Hilbert curve works mathematically and figure out how to implement it in Python. From what I remember, the Hilbert curve is a type of fractal that fills space completely without crossing itself. It starts at one corner of a square and ends at another, covering every point in between.

First, I should probably start by understanding the basic concept of a space-filling curve. These curves are interesting because they allow you to map a one-dimensional line into a two-dimensional or higher-dimensional space while maintaining locality—meaning points that are close on the line are also close in the higher dimension.

The Hilbert curve is particularly useful because it has good locality-preserving properties, which makes it useful in various applications like image processing and database indexing. But how exactly does it work?

I think the Hilbert curve can be generated recursively by dividing the space into quadrants and then drawing smaller curves within each quadrant. The key idea is that at each recursive step, you handle one of four quadrants and adjust your direction to ensure continuity.

Let me try to outline the steps for generating a Hilbert curve:

1. **Base Case**: At depth 0, the curve consists of just two points: the starting point (0,0) and the ending point (1,1).

2. **Recursive Step**: For each subsequent depth:
   - Divide the current square into four smaller squares (quadrants).
   - Recursively generate the Hilbert curve for each quadrant.
   - Connect these curves in a specific order to ensure that the entire space is filled without crossing.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact order of connecting the quadrants. I think it involves alternating directions—like moving right, then up, then left, then down—to create the continuous path.

I also recall that there's an iterative method involving bit manipulation that can generate the coordinates of the Hilbert curve without recursion. This might be more efficient for higher depths where recursion could become too slow or cause stack overflow issues.

Here's what I think the iterative approach involves:
- For each index along the curve, compute its corresponding (x, y) coordinates by interleaving bits from the index.
- The exact method involves reversing certain bit patterns to determine the direction of movement.

But I'm not entirely clear on how this works. Maybe I should look up an example or find a formula that maps the index to the coordinates.

Upon searching my memory, I think the key is to use Gray codes—binary numbers where successive values differ in only one bit—to map indices to coordinates. The Hilbert curve can be seen as a specific type of Gray code mapping.

So, for each point along the curve:
1. Convert the index to its binary representation.
2. Split this binary number into two parts: one part determines the x-coordinate, and the other determines the y-coordinate.
3. Reverse the order of bits in each part to get the correct coordinate.

But I'm not sure about the exact steps involved in reversing the bits or how to handle different depths.

I think I need to find a way to compute the coordinates for any given depth without recursion. Maybe using bitwise operations and loops instead.

Another idea is to use matrix transformations or lookup tables to determine the direction of movement at each step. This could involve creating a transformation matrix that rotates and scales the current position based on the quadrant being processed.

But I'm not sure how to implement this in code. Perhaps there's a standard algorithm or formula that can be used to generate the coordinates directly.

I also remember that the Hilbert curve has properties related to its dimensionality. For example, it's a continuous curve that maps from a one-dimensional line to a two-dimensional space, which is why it's called a space-filling curve.

In terms of implementation, I think the recursive approach might be more straightforward for understanding, even if it's not the most efficient for very high depths. So, let me try to outline how this would work in code:

1. **Recursive Function**: Define a function that takes the current depth and starting coordinates.
2. **Base Case**: At depth 0, add the starting point to the list of coordinates.
3. **Recursive Step**: For each quadrant:
   - Adjust the direction of movement based on the quadrant.
   - Recursively generate the curve for the next lower depth.
   - Append the generated points to the list.

But I'm still not entirely sure about how to manage the directions and ensure that the curve connects properly between quadrants.

Maybe I should try implementing this step by step, starting with a small depth and seeing if the code generates the expected pattern. If it doesn't, I can debug and adjust the parameters accordingly.

Another thing I need to consider is scaling the coordinates appropriately so that they fit within the unit square (from (0,0) to (1,1)). This might involve normalizing the values after generating them.

I also wonder about the efficiency of the recursive approach for larger depths. Python has a recursion limit, so for very deep curves, an iterative method or memoization might be necessary to avoid stack overflow errors.

In summary, I need to:
- Understand the mathematical properties of the Hilbert curve.
- Find a way to generate coordinates either recursively or iteratively.
- Implement this in Python using appropriate data structures and algorithms.
- Test the implementation with different depths to ensure correctness.

I think starting with the recursive approach is manageable. Once I have that working, I can explore optimizations for deeper curves if needed.

To plot the Hilbert curve for any depth using Python and matplotlib, we can use a recursive approach to generate the coordinates of the curve. The Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve that visits every point in a square grid exactly once.

### Approach
The Hilbert curve can be generated recursively by dividing the space into four quadrants at each step and drawing smaller Hilbert curves within each quadrant. The recursive function alternates the direction of traversal between quadrants to ensure continuity.

Here's a high-level overview of the approach:
1. **Recursive Function**: Define a helper function that takes the current depth, starting coordinates, width, and height of the quadrant.
2. **Base Case**: At depth 0, add the starting point.
3. **Recursive Step**: For each quadrant, recursively generate the Hilbert curve for the next lower depth, adjusting the direction of traversal to connect the quadrants correctly.

### Solution Code
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def generate_hilbert(depth):
    points = []
    def helper(n, x0, y0, width, height):
        if n == 0:
            points.append((x0, y0))
        else:
            half_width = width / 2.0
            half_height = height / 2.0

            # Top-right quadrant: move right then up
            helper(n-1, x0 + half_width, y0, half_width, half_height)
            # Move down to connect to next quadrant
            points.append((x0 + half_width, y0 + half_height))
            # Bottom-right quadrant: move down then left
            helper(n-1, x0 + width, y0 + half_height, -half_width, half_height)
            # Move left to connect to next quadrant
            points.append((x0, y0 + half_height))
            # Bottom-left quadrant: move left then up
            helper(n-1, x0, y0 + height, half_width, half_height)
            # Move up to connect to next quadrant
            points.append((x0 + half_width, y0))
            # Top-left quadrant: move up then right
            helper(n-1, x0, y0, width, height)
    helper(depth, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)
    return points

def plot_hilbert_curve(coordinates):
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
    plt.plot([x for x, y in coordinates], [y for x, y in coordinates], 'b-')
    plt.axis('equal')
    plt.title(f'Hilbert Curve (Depth {depth})')
    plt.show()

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    depth = int(input("Enter the depth of the Hilbert curve: "))
    coords = generate_hilbert(depth)
    plot_hilbert_curve(coords)
```

### Explanation
1. **Recursive Generation**: The `generate_hilbert` function uses a helper function to recursively build the list of coordinates. Each recursive call handles one quadrant, adjusting the direction of traversal to ensure continuity.
2. **Plotting**: The `plot_hilbert_curve` function takes the generated coordinates and plots them using matplotlib, ensuring the axes are equal to maintain the square aspect ratio.

This approach efficiently generates the Hilbert curve for any given depth by leveraging recursion and careful management of the traversal direction between quadrants.
