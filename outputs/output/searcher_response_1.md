Okay, so I need to figure out how to write a Python code that plots the Hilbert curve for any depth using matplotlib. Hmm, where do I start? I remember that the Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve, and it's recursive in nature. So maybe I should look into recursive functions or algorithms related to generating such curves.

First, I think about what the Hilbert curve looks like at different depths. At depth 0, it's just a line segment from (0,0) to (1,1). As the depth increases, the curve becomes more complex, folding back and forth in each quadrant. So perhaps there's a recursive way to plot this.

I should check if there are existing Python libraries or examples that generate Hilbert curves. Matplotlib is mentioned, so I'll look for matplotlib-based implementations. Maybe searching for "Hilbert curve Python code" will bring up some results. Also, considering the depth parameter, perhaps the code uses recursion where each level builds upon the previous one.

Wait, maybe there's a recursive function that takes the current points and generates the next level by dividing the square into quadrants and plotting lines in each. I should look for examples of such functions or algorithms. Alternatively, perhaps using numpy to generate the coordinates would be more efficient, but since the user wants matplotlib, I'll stick with plotting.

I also need to think about how to handle different depths. Each depth level adds more segments, so the number of points increases exponentially. So the code should dynamically adjust based on the input depth parameter.

Putting it all together, I might search for "recursive Hilbert curve Python" or "matplotlib Hilbert curve code." These keywords should help find existing implementations that can be adapted to accept a depth parameter and plot accordingly.
