Alright, I need to figure out how to help the user with their question about plotting the Hilbert curve in Python using matplotlib and getting exact coordinates for various depths. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I should understand what a Hilbert curve is. From what I remember, it's a continuous fractal space-filling curve. It starts at one corner of a square and ends at the opposite corner, passing through every point in between. The depth refers to how many times the pattern repeats, which affects the complexity and the number of points.

The user wants Python code for this, so I'll need to think about how to generate the curve's coordinates. I recall that there are recursive algorithms to generate Hilbert curves. Maybe I can find a function or algorithm that takes the depth as an input and returns the list of coordinates.

I should also consider using matplotlib to plot it. That means once I have the coordinates, I can use matplotlib's plotting functions to draw the curve.

Now, for the exact coordinates at various depths, I need to ensure that the code not only plots but also outputs these points accurately. Perhaps I can write a helper function that generates these points and then test it with different depths.

I should look up existing implementations of Hilbert curves in Python to see how others have approached this. Maybe there are libraries or modules that handle space-filling curves, which could simplify the process.

Additionally, I need to make sure that the code is efficient, especially since deeper levels will result in more points and a more complex computation. Optimizing the algorithm might be necessary for higher depths.

I also wonder about the base case for the recursion. For depth 0, it's just two points, right? As the depth increases, each segment splits into smaller segments, following the Hilbert pattern.

Testing will be crucial here. After writing the code, I should verify the coordinates at different depths to ensure accuracy. Maybe compare them with known values or visual representations of the curve.

Finally, putting it all together, I'll structure the code to generate the coordinates recursively, then plot them using matplotlib, and print out the points for testing purposes.
